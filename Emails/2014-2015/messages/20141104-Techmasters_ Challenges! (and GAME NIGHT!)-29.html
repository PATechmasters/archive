It's a terabyte of problems (and that's <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
maybe</span> definately a good thing)</p>
<br>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span>Tomorrow's meeting will be mostly focused on you guys solving CS problems of any kind (hacking, algorithms, forensics, etc).&nbsp; We're going to leave it really open-ended so you can choose what things to try
 and what things you want us to explain to you/help you with.&nbsp; This is because <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
we couldnt think of anything better to talk about</span> it'd be great to see what everyone's interested in.&nbsp;
<br>
We have a variety of web resources from which we can source problems in all areas... You guys can choose the topic, or bring a specific problem to our attention! (NO PICO PROBLEMS, sorry)<br>
Also, problem solvers will be definately entitled to awesome* prizes!<br>
(actually though: If you do well, we'll give you prizes during Game Night)<br>
<br>
To that end, we've finished our series of introductory tutorial meetings this term, and next term we'll move onto more in-depth stuff.<br>
What is this &quot;more in-depth stuff&quot; I'm talking about? <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
It's purposely super vague!</span><br>
That'll depend on you guys! If you have anything you want us to talk about, just email Cliff or me (or just tell us tomorrow) and we'll make a list of meeting topics.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, onto the reason you're <em>really </em>reading this email:</p>
<br>
<p>GAME NIGHT</p>
<br>
<p>That's right! Tomorrow we will be scheduling Techmasters Game Night.&nbsp; For those of you who are new, Game Night is when we all get to use the PACC after the library closes and hang out/eat junk food/play video games/neglect studying for finals.&nbsp; Tomorrow
 we'll talk about it and try to agree on a date.</p>
<br>
<p>So for challenges, problems, Game Night, and more, come to</p>
<br>
<p>TECHMASTERS (its in ALL CAPS this time!)<br>

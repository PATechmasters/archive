<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<br>
<p>Hope you all had a wonderfully RESTful break where you got to catch up on sleep(), see your parent
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">class</span> and hopefully have a good Time.&nbsp; Anyways, enough about break; What's this meeting on?</p>
<br>
<p>PROGRAMMING N' STUFF</p>
<br>
<p>Wow that was descriptive.&nbsp; Let's try again.<br>
Because your coding skills may have gotten RUSTy over break, you should totally come to this meeting.&nbsp; Still struggling to C the light?&nbsp; Come to this meeting.&nbsp; Or rather GO to this meeting.&nbsp; As you may be able to tell from these majestic puns, we'll be talking
 about compiled languages tomorrow, specifically C&#43;&#43;, Rust, and Go, and the advantages/disadvantages of each.&nbsp; No experience necessary.</p>
<br>
<p>ALSO</p>
<br>
<p>We have a very special guest coming to explain some of this stuff to you guys.&nbsp; Who is this expert?&nbsp;
<br>
PATRICK<br>
If you aren't a senior you may be wondering who Patrick is, but he went here and presided Techmasters for a couple of years.&nbsp; He's
<em>really </em>good at this stuff, and probably gives way better presentations than we do. Seriously.&nbsp; You should definately come to meet him. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORESome of you may have seen Tadaes wandering around campus in the last few days; he's also coming.&nbsp;
 Also, if you break the server, Aidan may come and not fix it.&nbsp; It's basically the board from before things got weird and we got two presidents (Whose idea was that? Wait...)So, for some new programming languages, the old Techmasters board, and more, come toTECHMASTERS<br>

<p>Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
You may be wondering why you are getting this Techmasters email during ultimate week.<br>
We wanted to remind everyone (or tell you for the first time, depending on your attendence of Techmasters meetings) about the best way to study, going into finals week:<br>
<br>
GAME NIGHT<br>
Friday, 7:00pm to 9:00pm<br>
The PACC<br>
<br>
There will be gaming, music, and food/drinks/candy for Techmasters to partake in, AFTER HOURS IN THE PACC. This means you, yes YOU, can eat food in the PACC, after it has closed for the night!<br>
We will probably have a Super Smash Bros. tournament (the original on n64, of course :D), we will play LAN games, and we will game on whatever cool consoles, new or old, people bring in.<br>
There is one catch though. A very small catch. To get a sense for numbers, and to furnish an email list for later communication about Game Night, you need to fill out the form below by Thursday morning. Don't worry, it's very short! Just two questions.<br>
<br>

<br>
So click the link, fill out the form, and get gaming this Friday night!<br>
<br>
<br>
See you then,<br>
<br>
The Board</p>

<p>Hello folks!<br>
<br>
What's this? An email from the elusive Clifford?<br>
Yes, like many of you I have had a sports conflict this term and have been unable to attend many of the meetings. I really wish I could be there and know why teapots are signifant or funny or something, but alas, I simply enjoy poking people with a long metal
 stick too much.<br>
<br>
So what is this email about? ELECTIONS.<br>
<br>
You, yes, that' right, YOU (assuming you have the qualifications laid out in the constitution of Techmasters) have the right to vote for the next Techmasters board!<br>
Yay!<br>

<br>
Attached are the platforms for each candidate (or pair of candidates), just as is the case for Student Council elections. If we want to accurately model this around StuCo elections, please don't read any of it before you vote and just cast a vote towards the
 names you recognize (friendship optional but preferred).<br>
In all seriousness, everyone has some great qualifications (and senses of humor) you can read about in the pdf; I highly advise looking through it.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow (technically today), we will assemble in Gelb 211 and begin the solemn process of voting (i.e. standing around cracking jokes while we wait for Jake to come up with some form of ballot because he forgot to make them tonight and/or second period).<br>
I hope to see you all then!<br>
<br>
<br>
TL;DR<br>
<br>
Techmasters Elections<br>
Gelb 211<br>
Wednesday, 1:30<br>
It's a terabyte of bringing your own pizza from Commons (sorry guys; a lack of organization on our part).<br>
<br>
<br>
Love you all &lt;3<br>
<br>
The Board</p>

<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<br>
<p>Our server is back up and we have two relatively simple problems running on it.&nbsp; We mentioned these in the meeting last week but now they're actually up, so feel free to try your hand at them.<br>
You can access them by connecting to student.andover.edu on port 1234 for the simple problem and 1235 for the slightly harder one.&nbsp; We're aware you don't have server accounts yet but our server administrator is working on that so you'll have them soon.&nbsp; The
 problems are solvable without a server account, but due to the school's firewall, you have to be on the school network to access them.&nbsp; You should have accounts by the next meeting and we'll discuss how to solve the problems with a server account then.&nbsp; If
 you can solve them before the meeting though, you may win awesome* prizes.*I think by this point we all know what this means<br>

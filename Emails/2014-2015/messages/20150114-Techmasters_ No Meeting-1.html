<p>Hi guys,<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the majority of the board (including our glorious leaders, Co President Clifford and Co President Jake) will be unavailable tomorrow afternoon.<br>
As such, tomorrow we are taking an afternoon off, which of course means you all should spend some time mastering technology on your own: code a game, make a website, or&nbsp;h̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶r̶o̶o̶m̶m̶a̶t̶e̶s̶ ̶c̶o̶m̶p̶u̶t̶e̶r̶ don't hack your roommate's computer
 because that would be totally against school rules and possibly immoral (? I never fully got the whole moral thing :/&nbsp;).<br>
<br>
See you all next week!<br>
<br>
<br>
Love,<br>
<br>
The Board</p>

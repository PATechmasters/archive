<p>Hey everyone!</p>
<br>
<p>As you can probably tell by the subject, tomorrow we'll be starting the selection process for next year's board.&nbsp; We were going to send this out a while ago, but then
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">we completely forgot</span> snow happened, so this email is later than normal.&nbsp; Actually, this email is just as punctual as most of the other emails we've sent<br>
BUT ANYWAYS<br>
<br>
Tomorrow, candidates will give very short speeches.&nbsp; Yes, that means you'll have to do some public speaking. Sorry about that.&nbsp; Basically, you should just tell us why you should be
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">glorious leader of great nation of</span> on the board of Techmasters.&nbsp; Don't worry too much about the speech; last year they were basically all improv (It's more entertaining that way).<br>
<br>
Available positions are:<br>
President<br>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Vice President</span> Assistant to the President<br>
Webmaster<br>
Server Admin<br>
<br>
If you can't make it to the meeting tomorrow but still want to run, don't worry: you can just email us.&nbsp; If you want to be a candidate, you should write a
<strong>short</strong> platform describing what you'll do with the position and why everyone should vote for you.&nbsp; Ideally, keep the amount of 0x4253 to the minimum; these aren't for English class.&nbsp; Platforms will be due Sunday by 5:00PM.&nbsp; Once we receive platforms
 from all candidates, we'll compile them into a LaTeX document and send you guys a beautifully typeset PDF of all the platforms.&nbsp; The actual election will be at next week's meeting.<br>
<br>
So, let's recap.&nbsp; If you want a board position:<br>
1. Come tomorrow and deliver a short speech<br>
2. Send us a platform by Sunday night<br>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3. Bribe the current board so you win</span><br>
4. Win!<br>
<br>

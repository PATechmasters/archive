<p>Hey everyone!<br>
<br>
In the beginning of the year, we told you we would give you all server accounts at around our second meeting. Since it is now
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">past midterm</span> totally the second week of school, we're having the meeting where you guys can get your server accounts!<br>
But why are we giving you server accounts at <em>this </em>specific meeting? Because this week we're talking about<br>
NETWORKING<br>
I was originally going to open this email with a joke about UDP, but then I realized you probably wouldn't get it.&nbsp; So then I thought to open with a TCP joke, but I'd have to keep repeating it until you got it.<br>
Yes, networking jokes are <em>always</em> this funny.<br>
Tomorrow, we'll cover a wide range of topics in networking such as protocols like TCP and UDP, ports, servers, firewalls, tunneling, and all kinds of other goodies that make the internet possible.<br>
We'll also get a brief presentation from Thayer about our server, what you can do with a server account, and how to get one.<br>
So to stop living your life thinking the Internet is a series of tubes (and to understand the
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">crappy</span> amazing jokes earlier in this email) come to:<br>
<br>
Techmasters<br>
Wednesday, 1:30<br>
Gelb 211<br>
It's a terabyte of fun, you don't even know<br>
<br>
If you can't make it to the meeting but want a server account, just email me.<br>
Also, now that you guys will have server accounts, we can start giving out problems that will let you win awesome* prizes!<br>
*we are <em>not</em> playing the footnote game again</p>

<p>CALLING ALL TECHMASTERS:<br>
<br>
Do you like video games?<br>
(YES)<br>
<br>
<br>
I know I sure as hell do! Although there's a big problem in my life:<br>
At Andover, with all my studies, I never have any time to play.*<br>
<br>
As per usual, Techmasters has the solution!<br>
<br>
Head on over to:<br>
<br>
<br>
GAME EVENING**<br>
Friday, 7:30 to 9:30<br>
GW, mailroom<br>
<br>
<br>
Techmasters is hosting a BYOC LAN party (BYOC = bring your own computer, LAN = local area network) in the mailroom!&nbsp;<br>
And best of all... there will be PIZZA!!!<br>
<br>
That's right gamers, real*** pizza.<br>
<br>
What games will we be playing?<br>
That is entirely up to you guys! You can play something on your own, or find other people to game with.<br>
To facilitate groups focusing on specific games (cough cough token league match going to happen cough), I made a quick strawpoll:<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Regardless of what you want to play, this Friday grab your laptop (and probably charger, mouse, and headphones too) and come on over to the mailroom to hang out with all your Techmasters friends, eat some pizza, and play some games!<br>
<br>
See you all then,<br>
<br>
The Board<br>

*Kant be damned; the whole &quot;no lying&quot; business isn't fun at all<br>
**Separate from &quot;Game Night,&quot; which is an event conducted in the PACC<br>
***&quot;Real&quot; unless we get Dominos, which we might do because I like actually like it for some inexplicable reason :&gt; (just pray Jake convinces me otherwise)</p>

<p>Hey everyone!<br>
<br>
This week we'll be talking about something very simple yet very important: TRIANGLES<br>
&quot;What is a triangle&quot;, you ask?&nbsp; Actually, I sincerely hope you don't ask that.&nbsp; What you should ask, however, is &quot;Why do we care about triangles?&quot;<br>
<br>
If any of you play video games (so basically all of you), you may already know the answer.&nbsp; Triangles are the fundamental building block of computer graphics.<br>
Everything on your screen is a triangle, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
unless you're on Google Plus; I heard they were trying to do stuff with circles and it didn't go so well.</span>
<br>
<br>
The floor in a game? Triangles.<br>
Your rectangular Firefox window? Two triangles (actually though).<br>
Your <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Vim</span> Emacs window? Triangles.<br>
Your Internet Explorer window?<br>
*slap*<br>
Sorry about that.<br>
<br>
Moving on from triangles, we'll talk about how the graphics pipeline works at a low level.&nbsp; We'll do some demos in OpenGL and possibly talk about how actual games work.<br>
We can also mess around with fragment shaders in a very cool way.&nbsp; If you want a preview, head over to shadertoy.com and check out some of the crazy stuff you can do.<br>
<br>
So, for lots of triangles, trippy shader effects, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
gaming</span> not gaming, and more, come to<br>

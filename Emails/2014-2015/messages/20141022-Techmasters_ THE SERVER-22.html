<p>Hello Mechtasters!<br>
<br>
We are thrilled to announce: (cue drum roll...)<br>
SERVER ACCOUNTS!!!!!!!11!!<br>
<br>
That's right, you, yes YOU could start using your very own server account tomorrow!<br>
So make sure to come to:<br>
<br>

Wednesday, 1:30 to 2:30<br>
<br>
As you might guess, we will be talking about the server. After the two recent meetings on OS/Linux/command line and networking, we know you guys are all pros at this server stuff. However, we are going to apply this knowledge and put you guys to the test!<br>
<br>
Speaking of tests, we have two problems currently up on the server for your enjoyment. Jake sent out an email earlier, and definitely try them before the meeting! There will be awesome* prizes!<br>
<br>
All future problems will also be released on the server, so if you'd like to do later problems make sure to stop by tomorrow to get your account set up.<br>
But seriously guys, give the problems a shot! We'd love to end up with (read: will be really surprised if we end up with) multiple problem solvers who can help us run tomorrow's meeting... at least TRY the problems; you may be surprised by how solveable they
 are.<br>
<br>
And if you have any difficulty with the probelms, we will explain the whole process of the solution at...<br>
<br>

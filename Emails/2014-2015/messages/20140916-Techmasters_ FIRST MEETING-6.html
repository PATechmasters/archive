<p>It's that time of Tuesday morning again!<br>
By the way, I'm typing this at 2:04AM but for some reason Blackboard is down so I'll have to send it later. My apologies for a late email!<br>
ANYWAYS<br>
That doesn't sound right. Why is it <em>Tuesday </em>morning? We normally get emails at strange hours on
<em>Wednesday</em> morning.&nbsp; Has the Techmasters board somehow figured out how to use the time machine in the basement of Gelb? (it's there; trust us)<br>
Sadly, time travel is a (very, very, very) far way away from today so it is in fact
<em>that</em> time of Tuesday morning.<br>
Why Tuesday?<br>
Because we now have</p>
<br>
<p>Techmasters<br>
Not on Wednesdays. Not at 1:30. Don't be <em>that guy</em> who shows up on Wednesday.<br>
Still in Gelb 211<br>
Still a terabyte of fun (and always will be)</p>
<br>
<p>We've decided to move the meeting time to Tuesdays at 5:00 in order to work better with everyone's busy schedules. Also, since that's around the same time as dinner, you're welcome to bring food (just don't make a mess).<br>
So be sure to come to</p>
<br>
<p><span style="text-decoration: line-through;">FOOD CLUB</span> Techmasters<br>
Tuesdays, 5:00-6:00<br>
Gelb 211</p>
<br>
<p>You may have noticed that Techmasters now meets for an hour instead of a half hour. That's right, you can now have two, yes two, terabytes of fun at the Techmasters meetings (although with that much fun you may run out of space).&nbsp; That's why we're going
 to spend the first half of the meetings providing an introductory overview of whatever the topic of the day is, and the second half will go further in depth. You're welcome to leave after a half hour if you don't want to stay for the more complicated part.</p>
<br>
<p>So it's been almost a whole page in this email and we haven't yet told you what the topic of our meeting is.<br>
On an unrelated note, the topic for this week's Techmasters meeting is nice and meta:<br>
TECHMASTERS MEETINGS<br>
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">They're meetings about Techmasters!</span></p>
<br>
<p>We'll talk about the club, what to expect from meetings, and if we have time, we'll go over the GPG challenge we gave you guys in one of our previous emails. Which none of you got. Even though we covered this exact topic in depth last year. And even had
 Patrick Niedzielski come all the way over from Cornell to explain it. Don't worry about it though.<br>
If you weren't at dorm blitzes, you're probably really confused as to what we're talking about. Basically, we're going to start giving out problems of the week that cover a wide range of topics. These are of course optional but people who solve them will get
 awesome* prizes<br>
*awesomeness is subjective **<br>
**dont worry about it, the prizes are actually awesome *</p>
<br>
<p>Recursive footnotes aside, we're also going to be doing work duty scheduling at the meeting. So if you are signed up for Techmasters work duty, please come to the meeting to pick the days work for you to work for us to work for the school. (what?). If you
 can't make it, please email Cliff or Jake and we'll make it work.</p>
<br>
<p>So if you want to have fun, hear ample amounts of <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
bad</span> fantastic humor, see our Techmasters meta-meeting meta-presentation and hack around with GPG, come to</p>
<br>
<p>Techmasters<br>
Tuesdays, 5:00pm<br>
Gelb 211<br>
It's multiple terabytes of fun, you don't even know.</p>
<br>
<p>See you guys <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">tomorrow</span> later today!<br>

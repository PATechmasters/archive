<p>Hello all!<br>
<br>
I will start by saying we will NOT be having a meeting tomorrow. Terribly sorry :(<br>
<br>
HOWEVER, we do have something for you. It may not be as good as a Techmasters meeting, but it's close.<br>
<br>
The Board presents to you:<br>
https://picoctf.com/<br>
<br>
Quick summary of the event:<br>
A hacking competition. Topics vary widely, and cover most large topics in cyber security and forensics.<br>
We highly recommend that you take some time out of your Wednesday afternoon to register for this contest (you may register at any time), and try a couple problems.<br>
And guess what we have for people who solve lots of problems?<br>
<br>
Yup, you guessed it, awesome* prizes!<br>
<br>
Best of luck to everyone!<br>
And if you try some problems and find it quite challenging, have no fear; we will review some of the concepts necessary for these challenges in our upcoming meeting next week... HACKING!<br>
We definitely recommend trying some problems before that meeting though. The more you guys look at beforehand, the more meaningful the meeting will be :)<br>
<br>
<br>
See you all next week,<br>
<br>
The Board</p>

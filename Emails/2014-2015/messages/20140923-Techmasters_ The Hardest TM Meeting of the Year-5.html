<p>Hello Techmasters!<br>
<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
<br>
Techmasters - Hardware (with actual computer c̶a̶n̶i̶b̶a̶l̶i̶z̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶ disassembly)<br>
Wednesday, 1:30 to 2:30<br>
Gelb, room 211<br>
<br>
----------------<br>
<br>
<br>
To all those who have asked, and more importantly for those who haven't, the decision has been made.<br>
Techmasters meetings will be conducted on:<br>
<br>
<br>
Wednesday, 1:30 to 2:30<br>
Gelb, room 211<br>
It's a terabyte of fun--you don't even know<br>
<br>
<br>
Because of the large number of Techmasters eager to retain the old time slot (by both in-person feedback as well as the survey), we will continue meeting on Wednesdays.<br>
Which brings us to the topic of this email: tomorrow's meeting.<br>
<br>
The topic is, in a nutshell (or maybe a microATX mini tower desktop case), HARDWARE.<br>
<br>
What is hardware? You might ask.<br>
<br>
hard·ware, noun, \ˈhärd-ˌwer\<br>
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"></span>1. The components of a computer only repairable through the use of ample kinetic energy, such as that delivered by a kicking or punching strike to the computer<br>
<br>
<br>
In all seriousness, hardware consists of all the physical components making up a computer (which all Techmasters involved in work duty must remember we are not allowed to service or repair!). Hardware differs from software in that software is completely virtual,
 with the only physical manifestation being the 1's and 0's (positive and negative charges) stored on the computer.<br>
Below are some examples for clarity.<br>
<br>
Hardware:<br>
---------<br>
Disk drive<br>
CPU<br>
USB<br>
RAM<br>
Monitor<br>
Second monitor<br>
Third monitor<br>
Fourth monitor<br>
Fifth monitor<br>
Sixth monitor<br>
...<br>
Three hundred four thousand twenty ninth monitor<br>
Mouse<br>
Second mouse... wait what? (*plays AD carry and support AT SAME TIME for max synergy*)<br>
<br>
Software:<br>
---------<br>
Chrome (or Firefox, or Ice Weasel, or even Safari... just not Internet Explorer. IE isn't software. It's manure.)<br>
MS Word<br>
MS Paint<br>
uTorrent (hey, don't look at me like that. I only use it for legal torrents...)<br>
Adobe Reader<br>
Adobe Reader's Updater<br>
Adobe Reader's Updater's Updater<br>
etc.<br>
<br>
For additional tangibility, we will be taking apart Jake's desktop, and you guys will be able to actually see the physical innards of a modern computer!<br>
<br>
I leave you with this anecdote related to the nature of hardware and software:<br>
My old desktop once beat me in a game of chess.<br>
However, I soon discovered it was no match for me in kickboxing.<br>
<br>
<br>
See you guys tomorrow!<br>

<p>Hey Techmasters!<br>
So last week we talked about hardware, which is the part of the computer that you can kick.&nbsp; Next up we have</p>
<br>
<p>SOFTWARE<br>
The part of a computer you can't kick!<br>
<br>
Specifically, we'll be discussing low-level <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">
(below 9000)</span> software, such as operating systems.&nbsp; And since we'll use basically any excuse, no matter how (in)valid, to talk about how awesome Linux is, our discussion of operating systems will probably center around Linux derivatives.&nbsp; Windows and
 OSX users, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">YOURE FIRED!</span> fear not, because we will maybe potentially address those at some point possibly in the meeting. Maybe. But
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">hacking</span> testing sessions on the Linux shell will definately be included.</p>
<br>
<p>Also, we'll go in-depth about the significance of this year's shirt.&nbsp; In case you haven't seen it, I've attached a text file that has the back of the shirt on it.&nbsp; You probably don't need the front because it's basically just us being condescending (something
 new and different).&nbsp; If you can figure out what the significance of it is, you may or may not receive an awesome* prize.<br>
*oh boy more footnotes; this'll be fun**<br>
**if you didn't see the previous email, you're probably really confused right now...<br>
***The first footnote lied, this isn't fun<br>
**Disregard the footnote above the one below the lying one*<br>
* WHOA GUYS THE LEFT PART LOOKS LIKE AN ARROW<br>
<br>
BUT ANYWAYS<br>
To learn about low-level programming, OS's, Linux, breaking poorly-written C programs, deciphering the gibberish on the back of this year's Techmasters shirt, and understanding the following reference (and more!), come to</p>

It's 1.0x10^12&#43;2 bytes of fun, you don't even know! (but will find out tomorrow!)</p>

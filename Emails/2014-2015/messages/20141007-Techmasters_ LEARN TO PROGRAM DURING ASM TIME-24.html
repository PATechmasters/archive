<p>Hello everyone!<br>
<br>
As you might remember from Mr. Hoyt's email, we have NO ASM TOMORROW!<br>
If you didn't read his email, be happy about the free time tomorrow :)<br>
<br>
We've decided that means tomorrow, during the normal ASM time, we will conduct a Techmasters meeting!<br>
That's right. the meeting will not be at the normal time. DON'T come to Gelb at 1:30, and instead come to:<br>
<br>
<br>
Techmasters<br>
Gelb, room 211 (unless posted/emailed about a different location)<br>
10:50 am</p>
<br>
<p><br>
Many of you might be wondering what the topic is (if you have utterly failed to read the obvious subject line).<br>
First we would probably refer you to said subject line, and then carefully explain we will be talking about PROGRAMMING!<br>
<br>
For some of the meeting, we will be doing something along these lines:<br>
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how&#43;to&#43;program<br>
<br>
And by that we mean we will be providing instruction on making use of the multitudes of amazing online resources about coding.<br>
<br>
In addition to talking about learning programming, we will also discuss a variety of programming languages.<br>
Languages we will talk about in a little extra detail:<br>
<br>
Ruby<br>
Perl<br>
PHP (Security vulnerabilities in code-form)<br>
Java<br>
C&#43;&#43;<br>
C with classes<br>
See with glasses<br>
C-sharp<br>
C-flat<br>
C--<br>
D<br>
F#<br>
S<br>
Visual J# (Oh Microsoft...)<br>
6̶4̶ ̶b̶i̶t̶ ̶A̶s̶s̶e̶m̶b̶l̶y̶ (nevermind; that fiasco was last meeting...)<br>
<br>
You might notice this list is very similar to that of last year. After careful consideration, we have drastically improved the quality of our selection through the removal of Python from the list. Our benchmarks (and by that I mean every indication possible)
 show that with Python gone from tomorrow's meeting we will be finished quite a bit faster.<br>
<br>
So if you want to learn about programming languages, how to use them, and what the joke I just made in the previous sentence means, come to:<br>
<br>
<br>
Techmasters<br>
Gelb, room 211 (unless posted/emailed about a different location)<br>
10:50 am<br>
<br>
<br>
Much love,<br>
<br>
The Board</p>

<p>i wonder how many emails i can send in quick succession before people start sending me angry letters telling me to take them off our mailing list</p>
<br>
<p>ANYWAY</p>
<br>
<p>You may remember me mentioning some opportunities to do something cool with Robotics club earlier; a few of you have already contacted me (and I will get back to you with particulars eventually, or you can go sign yourself up&nbsp;by emailing him at
<span><span>tvitale</span></span>). However, I've also been asked to help gather programmers to work on a competitive robotics team. Note that, as this (presumably) an interscholastic competitive team, they'd probably appreciate more advanced programmers with
 experience working with a variety of interfaces. The commitment would be a few hours a week (separate from regular robotics club meetings), so make sure your schedule can handle it. If you're interested, you can email
<span><span>jshen</span></span>1 (at <span><span>andover</span></span>.<span><span>edu</span></span>) and
<span><span>tvitale</span></span>.</p>

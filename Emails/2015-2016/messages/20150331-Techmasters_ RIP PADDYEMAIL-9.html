<p>So let me preface this by saying this email wooouuuld have been out sooner had a certain person actually done what they said they would (did? done? grammar is hard).</p>
<br>
<p>IMPORTANT INFO:</p>
<br>
<p>TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>WEDNESDAY AT 1:30</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>taught by the magnificient and LIARFACE PADDY NEZZIE OR SOMETHING (not gunna lie, imma have to check facebook for the correct spelling).</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TERABYTE OF FUN (screw that extra r business classic is where it's at)</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>WHO IS this WONDERFUL and mysterious LIARFACE, no one ever would ask because the legend of paddy may or may not have spread to my former house counselor's cat by this point (I think it's in maine now. gets around for a cat). but to CLARIFY, PADDY was the
 president of techmasters known for his TECHNOLOGICAL GENIUS and AGGRESSIVE HARMONICA PLAYING, providing bulfinch with the AMBIANCE PERFECTLY SUITED for in class essays, intense discussions of phallic imagery, and general english-ing. he also held the RECORD
 for HEAVIEST BACKPACK ON CAMPUS, beating out the MANY FRESHMEN who start their year carrying ALL THEIR BOOKS ALL DAY ERRY DAY. like damn son no one should ever ask you &quot;do you even lift, bro&quot;, because then it'd be like &quot;does a backpack count&quot; or something
 like that. probably.&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>(no but actually like this guy's seriously good at computers. probably life, too. come to bask in his presence or learn by osmosis.)</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>COME SPREAD THE GOSPEL OF PADDY</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>and reinvigorate the rivalry? with conlangs? except not, because they're pretty chill.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>LOOK AT THIS&nbsp;</p>

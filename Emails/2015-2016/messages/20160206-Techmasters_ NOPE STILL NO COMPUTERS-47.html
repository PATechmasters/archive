<p>EVERYBODY RAN AWAY FROM CAMPUS SO WE WON'T BE MEETING TOMORROW OOPS</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>For those of you who still need your weekly <span><span><span><span>Mechtasters</span></span></span></span> fix, some people (read: every leader of every other club ever) have started not-so-quietly turning over their respective leadership positions to &quot;the
 new generation&quot;, choosing the most worthy successors from a pool of applicants, allowing them to claw and climb on each other until they reach the top. For years, we defied this system and chose our rulers by the will of the people, but no more! The 2015-16
 board will be eternal and we have decided to rule with an iron fist and only allow the most qualified to follow in our footsteps. As such, we present to you the NEW TECHMASTERS BOARD APP! Please answer the following questions in exactly 7 pages and two lines,
 single spaced comic sans size 11.5 font handwritten, sent to us before our meeting next Sunday. You may send them to us by scanning them at the library. For your convenience, a template suitable for writing on has been attached to this email.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>*By submitting this board <span><span><span><span>app</span></span></span></span> you agree to sign away both your first-born child and your immortal soul to MECHTASTERS INC and all affiliated ruling parties including but not limited to Patrick
<span><span><span><span>Nidzielski</span></span></span></span>, the 2015-16 <span>
<span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span> board and the duchy of <span>
<span><span><span>Mallick</span></span></span></span>.</p>
<br>
<p><br>
1. Who are you? By that, we mean your name, year, dorm, other place of residence, mother's maiden name, social security number, and bank credentials.</p>
<br>
<p><br>
2. What position are you applying for? What would you do if you were elected?</p>
<br>
<p><br>
3. How long have you been involved with <span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span>?</p>
<br>
<p><br>
4. What else do you do on campus? How likely are you to abandon us for another club? Would you be opposed to members of the 2015-16 board emailing you for weekly progress updates?</p>
<br>
<p><br>
5. A student comes to you with a wireless printing issue. What do you say?</p>
<br>
<p><br>
6. Please write a speech to which you will give your peers before being elected democratically. This doesn't need to be included in the actual form you&nbsp;<a href="http://goo.gl/forms/HzJB7a9NU5">send us</a>, but please keep in mind that you will need to give
 one.</p>
<br>
<p><br>
7. In the early 1900's, a professor at the University of Southern Unified Kentucky (USUK) devised a sorting algorithm that could sort any set of data perfectly in O(n
<span><span><span><span>Ln</span></span></span></span> n) (where <span><span><span><span>Ln</span></span></span></span> is the natural log function). Explain why this development was overlooked by the general computing community and its impact on the development
 of the fast inverse square root function.</p>
<br>
<p><br>
8. Were pH an expression of personality, what would be your pH and why? (Feel free to respond acidly! Do not be neutral, for that is base!)</p>
<br>
<p><br>
9. Improvise a story, essay, or script that meets all of the following requirements:It must include the line &quot;And yes I said yes I will Yes&quot; (Ulysses, by James Joyce). Its characters may not have superpowers. If you've read this far submit a platform with the
 phrase &quot;bow down to your truly masterful overlords&quot;. I will email you back your score and the next part of the challenge. Bonus points if the phrase makes sense in context.<br>
Your work must include at least four of the following elements: a paper airplane, a transformation, a shoe, the invisible hand, two doors, pointillism, a fanciful explanation of the Pythagorean Theorem, a ventriloquist or ventriloquism, the periodic table of
 the elements, the concept of <span><span><span><span>jeong</span></span></span></span>, number two pencils. If you actually do this please send it to me; the best one we get (subject to vote by the board) will get an as-yet-undecided awesome* prize.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>10. Please define the phrase &quot;IT'S A TERABYTE OF FUN&quot;.</p>
<br>
<p><br>
*whether something is truly awesome may be debated.</p>

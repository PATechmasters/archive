<p>THE LAST EMAIL GOT SENT TO ONLY THE BOARD</p>
<br>
<p>I APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY</p>
<br>
<p>IDK WHAT HAPPENED MAN</p>
<br>
<p>We're meeting at 5:15 PM IN GELB, SAME ROOM. APPARENTLY IT WORKS FOR MORE PEOPLE.</p>
<br>
<p>Here's the email written by Tadeas:</p>
<br>
<p>Hello!</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>There comes a time every (from my sample size of ~4) year when Techmasters invites various people to give guest presentations. Some of those people are Patrick! Some of them are Aidan Beckley wearing a fake moustache telling you about how whitespace is silly!
 And some of them are neither!</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>So it is I! Not-Patrick-And-Not-Aidan-Wearing-A-Moustache! Also known as Not-(Patrick-Or-Aidan-Wearing-A-Moustache)! However, unlike most people who are not Aidan wearing a fake moustache, I WILL be telling you about how Whitespace is silly!</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Anyway, did you ever sit down at a computer, planning on writing some code, and just feel disgusted with the state of programming languages as they are today? Do they just feel... wrong to you? Do things like &quot;convenience&quot; and &quot;even vaguely resembling something
 created by sane people&quot; bother you? Well, now, there's a solution for you that isn't bizarre Perl scripts you find online!</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>COME TO ESOTERIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES!</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TECHMASTERS OF CONLANGS!</p>
<br>
<p>[Insert time and location here, since I'm no longer sure of exactly what it is.]</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Or something like that.</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>With ESOTERIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES, you too can harness the power of:</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- acronyms, and having a thorough understanding of how they are supposed to work</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- truly adventurous compiler errors</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- trampolines</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- whitespace being used as something more than just a formatting tool</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- being able to program things with a keyboard with 8 buttons on it</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- being able to &quot;program&quot; &quot;things&quot; with a &quot;keyboard&quot; with 4 buttons on it</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- accidentally mistaking your English homework for your scripts</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- understanding the hot new pop culture references</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- whatever the hell the crazy operator in Malbolge is supposed to do</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;- etc! I'm running out of time, and my NaNs are at stake.</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>COME TO TECHMASTERS!</p>
<br>
<p>I'M FINISHING THIS EMAIL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE!</p>
<br>
<p>[INSERT TIME AND PLACE HERE AGAIN]</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TERABYTE OF FUN!</p>
<br>
<p>PLZ DON'T HURT MY NON-NUMBERS</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br>
<p>Not-Patrick-Or-Not-Aidan</p>
<br>
<p>AKA: Tadeas</p>

<p>Hi <span><span>everyon</span></span>e - I'm not sure if I mentioned this during orientation, but part of your work duty should be to check the student printers regularly to make sure there's enough paper. You don't have to worry about the ones in the library,
 but the <span><span>SamPhil</span></span> printer and the one in the mail room, should be on your regular route.</p>
<br>
<p>At the moment, the printer in <span><span>SamPhil</span></span> is out of paper - we gave them a ream for now, but please run more over when you have a chance. You can
<span><span>tak</span></span>e what you need from the cabinet to the left of my desk in the PACC, or from the boxes in the corner of Seminar 1 (to the right as you wa<span><span>lk</span></span> in).</p>
<br>
<p>Please send me a quick email when this is taken care of so I know it's done. Thanks! Also, keep your eyes peeled from an email from Mr. Barker about the maker space - it's almost ready to go!</p>
<br>
<p>--David</p>

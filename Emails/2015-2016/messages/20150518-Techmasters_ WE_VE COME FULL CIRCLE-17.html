<br>
<p>COME TO TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p>TUESDAY 7:15p</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>A TERABYTE OF CIRCLES WOULD BREAK YOUR COMPUTER, SO WE HAVE A TERABYTE OF FUN INSTEAD</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>If anyone remembers back to the start of the term, we kept promising &quot;game dev! game dev!&quot; And then the great Unity Disaster of Cam's Computer happened, and crashcourse.exe crashed. Miserably. (I can only hope that, in fact, that will be our only failure
 in our tenure as the board, and that the rest of our time will be fruitful and relatively crash-free)</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Well, as it so happens, you're&nbsp;<em>still</em> going to get game dev, because we're awesome enough to follow up on our promises! Although it might not be exactly the kind of game dev you were thinking of - there will be no lasers, or hearthstone (well, there
 may be hearthstone, depending on how much of a&nbsp;<em>blast to the past</em> people are looking for), or little ascii gnomes waving swords around. Instead, we're going to be talking&nbsp;<em>about</em>&nbsp;the technical aspects of from-scratch game dev, what it entails,
 and maybe a demonstration of how you can get started (look ma, no unity!). If there's time, we'll also talk about game development in a larger setting (particularly the organizational/business aspects of it), and why Rito Gaems never seems to get anything
 done.</p>

<p>ACTUALLY A TERABYTE OF FUN WOULD BREAK YOUR COMPUTER TOO</p>

<br>
<p>One last thing - If you signed up for dorm blitzes, we'll be getting the relevant information out to you in the next few weeks. If you haven't signed up, please do, because we'd like to get as complete a list of names as we can before school is out.</p>

<p>Hello, <span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span>! You may be wondering why we're contacting you this early in the year, since clubs aren't even open yet! For that matter, we haven't even had the club rally
 yet!&nbsp;<em>What's the deal???</em></p>
<br>
<p>Well, as many of you may know, last year we ran into a bit of an attendance problem. A lot of this was likely because of uninteresting meetings (especially towards the end of each term), but I've had multiple people tell me that they would like to come if
 it weren't for time conflicts. As such, anyone reading this can now help us decide the</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>TECHMASTERS MEETING TIME</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>WHO KNOWS WHAT DAY AND WHAT TIME</p>
<br>
<p>I REALLY HOPE IT'LL BE A TERABYTE OF FUN</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>For what it's worth, both Karen and I have a (hopefully)&nbsp;<em>fully sick</em>&nbsp;plan for the term all sketched out, no part of which includes &quot;sit there and watch Cam code&quot; or &quot;Cam and/or Karen give a really lame and/or contrived lecture that nobody cares about&quot;,
 and we'd really love it if as many people as possible could make it. Unfortunately, we won't be able to accommodate&nbsp;everyone until someone finds where the administration hid the Time Turners, but by voting&nbsp;<a href="http://doodle.com/poll/decfw39mbf5h9d2e">here</a>,
 you'll increase the chance that the meeting time will be good for you personally!</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>TL;DR VOTE <a href="http://doodle.com/poll/decfw39mbf5h9d2e">HERE</a></p>
<br>
<p>OR HERE:&nbsp;<span><span>http</span></span>://doodle.com/poll/<span><span>decfw</span></span>39<span><span>mbf</span></span>5h9d2e</p>
<br>
<p>YES THAT WAS JUST THREE LINKS TO THE SAME THING</p>
<br>
<p>JUST DO IT (<span><span>shia</span></span> <span><span>labeouf</span></span>)</p>

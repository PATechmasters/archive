<p>The time you've all been waiting for has arrived (you'd better have been waiting for it, because I'm not going to remember any of the four people who've asked me in person)! Signups for
<b>DORM BLITZES</b>&nbsp;are open!&nbsp; Want to show up and lord your&nbsp;<em>technical skill</em> over the freshman? Need an excuse to book that early plane ticket? Just want to get away from mom and dad a few days early? Sign up for&nbsp;<strong>DORM BLITZES</strong> now!</p>

<p>For those attempting to book flights, tentative arrival date is between 1-2 on Thursday, September 3. Once you sign up, we'll send out an email with all the extra information about when, where, and what exactly to do when you get here, bags in hand, wondering
 what to do now that the big crowd of BKH's isn't leading you around anymore! (If you're reading this mid-summer and desperately wondering whether you can still sign up, the answer is&nbsp;<em>yes</em>! Just fill out the form as usual and shoot us an email to make
 sure we remember to send you the start-of-school information just like everyone else)</p>

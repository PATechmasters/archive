<p>There was a Wii display cable dangling from the projector at the end of last night that ended up in Cliff's bag; I don't remember who exactly brought their wii but if you did I would recommend that you make sure that all your wires are present. If the mystery
 cable is yours, contact the board or, preferably, Cliff himself to get it back ASAP.</p>

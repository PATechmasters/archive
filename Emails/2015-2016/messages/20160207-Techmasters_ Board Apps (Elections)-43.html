<p>Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
As you can probably tell from the subject (or Cam's earlier email), we will soon be starting the election process for next year's board.&nbsp;Here's how the process works:<br>
<br>
1) All candidates must complete a board application. If you would like to be a candidate, please fill out the form
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/HzJB7a9NU5" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;by noon on Sunday, February 14, 2016.<br>
2) Candidates who have completed the form will give a brief speech during our 1:45PM meeting on Sunday, February 14, 2016*, telling us&nbsp;why they should be on the board of Techmasters.<br>
3) The completed board application of each candidate&nbsp;may be distributed among members of the club to better inform the electorate.<br>
4) We will hold an election on Sunday, February 21, 2016. Club members who are physically present and have attended at least one&nbsp;Techmasters meeting in the 2015-2016 school year prior to February 20, 2016&nbsp;will be eligible to vote.<br>
4) The new board will be announced on or before Friday, February 26, 2016.<br>
<br>
Available positions are:<br>
<br>
President (or 2&nbsp;Co-Presidents)<br>
Assistant President<br>
Webmaster<br>
Server Administrator<br>
<br>
Although each position has <a href="https://static.patechmasters.com/board-description.doc" target="_blank">
its own set of responsibilities</a>, all board members are expected to run meetings.<br>
<br>
We welcome all interested members of the club to fill out the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/HzJB7a9NU5" target="_blank">
form</a> and run in this election! This is a great opportunity for you to become more involved and share your knowledge with other people.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to the elections!<br>
- The Board<br>
<br>
*If you absolutely cannot make it to the meeting on February 14 but would still like to run, please let us know by February 13 and explain your circumstances. You can still run.</p>

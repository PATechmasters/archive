<br>
<p>As I sit down to write this email, the sounds of my dormmates playing League of Legends washes over me (this sentence is copypasta'd from when I lost this email an hour ago), particularly the line &quot;Gems are outrageous&quot; (well, it was actually &quot;OH GOD WHY
 ARE THEY THERE RUN&quot; but nobody's counting), because gems are the hallmark of a particular scripting language that will not be named (hint:
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">RUBY</span> IS FOR VIGOR) (i only made that connection because i was writing this email and that line may or may not have actually been said).</p>
<br>
<p>See, the thing about web dev is that people often equate it to a single process that has few variations. Almost like it's constrained to a set of&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">rails</span>, unable to go in any direction other than forwards or
 backwards (whether or not this impression is accurate will not be discussed at the meeting) (or will it? i'm not the one giving the presentation) (well i suppose i can still control whether that issue gets discussed but i probably won't)</p>

<br>
<p>IT'S A THINLY VEILED HINT ABOUT THE MEETING TOPIC (it's also a terabyte of fun)</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>So, as you may or may not have guessed, tomorrow's meeting is about Ruby on Rails. Have you ever wanted to make a website in weeks instead of months? Days instead of weeks? Hours instead of days? Minutes instead of hours? Well, that last one might not reasonably
 happen, but Ruby on Rails can promise all of these others! Rails is a &quot;new&quot; up-and-coming web framework that, according to personal accounts, is a huge improvement on anything else these web 2.0 plebs have ever used before. Javascript? TERRIBLE AND OBSELETE.
 HTML? STILL-RELEVANT-BUT-NO-LONGER-SCARY! PHP? THAT WAS ALWAYS AWFUL ANYWAY. SQL? YOU MIGHT STILL HAVE TO US- wait,&nbsp;<em>TUESDAY</em> night?</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Yes, well, you may or may not have noticed that, in our everlasting quest to find the best meeting time, we've decided to try a meeting time that our esteemed JakeCliff former presidents have already tried and decided against! According to the doodle poll,
 that was one of the most-commonly-requested (despite musical obligations, which surprised me) times, so we're deciding to give it a try. Of course, if this truly was Hogwarts, we'd all be Hermione (let's be real - most people here would be Hermione) and have
 the Time Turners so none of our commitments overlap! (this is not getting into any of the continuity errors time travel may cause - this is Tasters of Mechnology club, not Fiction Plothole Critique club, as much overlap as there may be).</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>COME TO TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p>TUESDAY 7:15p</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S AN ANACHRONISTIC MESS OF FUN</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>If this time doesn't work for you but another one does, please let us know! Because apparently nobody actually used the doodle poll &gt;_&gt;</p>

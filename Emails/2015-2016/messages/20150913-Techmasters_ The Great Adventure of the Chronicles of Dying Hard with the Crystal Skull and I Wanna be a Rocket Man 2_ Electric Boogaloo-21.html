<p>Now that I have your attention:</p>
<br>
<p>Hello, world! As you may have noticed, your <span><span>inbox</span></span> is most likely currently filling up with some assortment of new and exciting club emails, of which this is one! What does that mean for you? Well, based on experimental data, your
 reaction to a new club email probably falls into one of three categories: &quot;Yes! The [insert club] email arrived! It's what I've been waiting for my entire life!&quot;, &quot;Who is this Cameron J Wong guy and why is he emailing me instead of doing his physics homework?&quot;
 and &quot;Wait, we have an Andover Cole Slaw society?&quot; My dearest hope is that this email falls into the first category and not the second (the third is okay as well, I suppose, although I can't promise that I can give you Cole Slaw), but if you read this email
 and decide that you'd rather not add to the rapidly growing pile of club emails (I always used to wonder if they reproduced), just respond and we'll take you off. Sadly.</p>
<br>
<p>ONTO THE NEXT ORDER OF BUSINESS: everyone should sign up for gaming club. because that is a thing that got approved. somehow. also you should totally</p>

<br>
<p>See, we have to have our meeting time and place in all-caps, just in case people skim it. Maybe that's why nobody goes to Robotics club. For those of you who've been with us for a while, you may notice that we're no longer meeting on Tuesdays. Or Wednesdays.
 Or any other day of the week. That's because, by community census, we've decided that MONDAY is the best day ever.</p>
<br>
<p>This first meeting will be the obligatory meta-meeting about <span><span>Techmasters</span></span> meetings. We're going to be learning everybody's names, and giving some sort of explanation of what exactly it is we do around campus, and then (if time permits)
 some kind of quick learn-to-code session. So, in case you missed it the first time</p>

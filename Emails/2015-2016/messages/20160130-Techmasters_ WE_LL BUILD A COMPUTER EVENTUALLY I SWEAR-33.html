<p>When life gives you lemons...</p>
<br>
<p>Now, I know we've had a ripped-to-shreds computer sitting in the <span><span><span><span>makerspace</span></span></span></span> for months now. I'm fully aware of what I promised during the club rally. What I didn't expect was that, uh, unexpected complications
 would result in an inability to actually make a computer yet. Last week was the physics
<span><span><span><span>olympiad</span></span></span></span>, this week our computer guy has a Cornell interview... what's a club gotta do, huh?</p>
<br>
<p>I'll tell you - we <em>eat girl scout cookies</em>. And by&nbsp;<em>making video</em>
<em>games,</em>&nbsp;I mean that we go out and collect girl scout cookies.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>That's right. Instead of the whole wishy-washy &quot;let's learn to code&quot; things we've been doing up to now, we're going to walk you through using an actual game engine, written in Java to make a kind of
<span><span><span><span>roguelike</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;RPG game. If you want to get a head start, you can download the project Karen, myself and others put together from&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/PATechmasters/GSCQ-Engine">here</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, it isn't Tuesday yet. Or, for that matter, it isn't Wednesday at 3 AM yet, either!&quot;</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>so yeah panet is going down tomorrow and i know i'm going to forget to send this if i don't send this now so just pretend it's tuesday afternoon when you read this. maybe you should save this email somewhere and don't read it until tuesday afternoon. or
 i suppose you could just read this email while pretending to do your standard tuesday afternoon activities that you would normally be doing at the time this email would be sent (although that might include &quot;reading the techmasters email&quot;, and if anybody asks
 i did NOT say it was okay to practice recursive email reading)</p>

<p>When I was a wee little freshman, the highlight of my week would always be on Tuesday afternoon, when Patrick would send out the Techmasters email. I would read it, be immensely amused (asI am wont to do), then think to myself how awesome it would be to
 be president of a club and write my own emails. This trend continued with the Tadoshu emails of last year, and then again with JakeCliff (that is pronounced Jay-Cliff, and it is decidedly *not* a shipping name. Unless you want it to be. In which case don't
 let me stop you). Now that I *am* writing emails, it struck me that writing emails is *really, really hard*. It doesn't help that according to SOME PEOPLE, my email was by far the most inferior of the three that have been sent out thus far (I cry, Yatharth.
 I really do). So much pressure, man! (I may or may not be writing this email way in advance because I truly have nothing better to do and am choosing to be salty over a comment made to me over facebook chat regarding the Patrick email or actually because I
 know that I'm going to be swamped and will forget) (wow this whole &quot;write the email in advance&quot; strategy seems to be kind of cool maybe i should start doing that more often) (actually never mind that only works if i know what the topic is going to be and that
 only worked this time because of a blind guess)</p>
<br>

You know what else is stressful? College admission day is stressful (Too soon? OH WELL I'M EDGY YOU CAN DEAL). But so are techmasters emails without a defined purpose, and I can fix one of those two things (there was this movie that involved a guy and his friends
 faking a college so his parents wouldn't be super disappointed in him and then people actually applied and then they ended up faking the school and getting accredited and stuff and it was really weird and when I realize that people way more qualified than
 me are crying right now I begin seriously taking it into consideration):</p>

IT'S AN EXCESS 'R' OF FUN</p>
<br>
<p><br>
&quot;Wait, you didn't actually tell us what the-&quot; shhhhhh</p>
<br>
<p><br>
Tomorrow, we're going to put into motion our plans for the rest of the term - that is, we'restarting the Mechtasters crash course on game development. We'll be discussing how to install and set up Unity, and then we're going to make a (very) basic text-based
 game off it. There may or may not also be mayonnaise. Originally, the board wanted to try to make a game as a club together, but that's not really the kind of thing we can do without having meetings consisting of four people watching me code for an hour, so
 we're instead going to be doing aside-by-side thing that'll have (hopefully) a bunch of games coming out of it at the end.</p>

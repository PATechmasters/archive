<p>If you are one of the&nbsp;<em>many</em> people who have contacted me (or Karen) about Techmasters work duty, keep reading. For that matter, even if you haven't, you should probably keep reading just in case there might be&nbsp;<em>very fun things</em>&nbsp;in this email.</p>
<br>
<p>So, regarding work duty - As you may or may not have noticed, Techmasters is listed as &quot;closed&quot; on the form. That's fine, as far as I know we're still &quot;open&quot;, you can still get in. However, you should still put down some choices that you feel you'd be okay
 with doing as a contingency, because despite everything I just said,&nbsp;<em>you are not guaranteed a spot.</em></p>
<br>
<p><em>&quot;</em>But Cam, what am I supposed to do then?&quot; - The person to ask would be Mr. Mallick, not the board. While there is a brief qualification exam you'd need to fill out to make sure you're up to the type of work we do every term, ultimately (as far as
 I know), he's the one who handles all the attendance (etc) (about the exam, contact me and I'll get back to you).</p>
<br>
<p><strong>There are only a limited number of slots, so don't sit on your&nbsp;</strong><strong>hands forever.</strong>&nbsp;For that matter, we haven't had nearly enough signups for dorm blitzes, and everyone should totally sign up,&nbsp;<em>especially</em> if you were asking
 about work duty... <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aUXergMy6-3mQOiewtMKiISejv8SJitwEMMEBzVe6t0/viewform?usp=send_form">
(hint hint).</a></p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>So, those fun things I promised:&nbsp;<strong>TECHMASTERS GAME NIGHT!!!!!</strong>&nbsp;Game night is scheduled for&nbsp;<strong><em>this</em>
<em>Friday</em></strong><em> </em>at <strong>7-10!!!&nbsp;</strong>By now, I'm sure that most of you know the drill - be at the library, call the number, you're away! There will be pizza and drinks served, so even if you don't want to play
<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">League of Legends&nbsp;</span>Heroes of the Storm for three hours, you can still come and hang out, and watch me play Goat Simulator!</p>
<br>

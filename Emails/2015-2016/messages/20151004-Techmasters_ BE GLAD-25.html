<p>Or at least don't be sad, because there's unfortunately</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>NO TECHMASTERS MEETING</p>
<br>
<p>NOT ON MONDAY 7-8</p>
<br>
<p>THERE WON'T BE ANYONE IN GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TERABYTE OF DISAPPOINTMENT</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>It's midterms, which means that everyone has their own problems to deal with right now. And by &quot;everyone&quot;, I primarily mean me (but I'm sure a lot of other people do too!). See, I was going to throw together something we could actually do tomorrow but then
 fall midterms happened and I didn't have time. Well, also procrastination and sleep happened, but seniors are actually immune to such human things like that (obviously) so it's just because we were, uh, occupied by a super secret board meeting that took all
 weekend. Oh well.</p>

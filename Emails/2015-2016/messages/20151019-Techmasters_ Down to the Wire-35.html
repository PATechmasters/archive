<p>Last meeting, while we were busy looking at poorly drawn diagrams of a CPU's guts and fiddling with screwdrivers and wires and pointy things that may or may not still work, I was struck by a strange thought.&nbsp;<em>What&nbsp;</em>is<em> a computer?</em></p>
<br>
<p>You may think that's a silly question, coming from the glorious dictator-for-life-but-not-really-i-wish of the Masters of Technology, but it's a good one. Anybody can tell you that a computer is this magical box (or, at this point, even just a random plastic
 plate) that you can use to surf the <span><span>internet</span></span> and&nbsp;play League of Legends, but beyond that is a little harder. How&nbsp;<em>exactly&nbsp;</em>does a computer do the things it does? Want to find out?</p>

<br>
<p>Tomorrow (or, I suppose, later today), we'll be examining what it is inside a computer that makes it tick. Literally and theoretically. Don't worry if you've never really dealt with electronics before; we'll try to keep out of the really
<span><span>nitty</span></span>-gritty stuff.&nbsp;In the wise words of our server master (who will, incidentally, also be running tomorrow's meeting): &quot;basically everything else is
<span><span>elwctonics</span></span> to <span><span>buodl</span></span> a comp&quot;.<span style="color: #000000; font-family: 'andale mono', times; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 20.48px; orphans: auto; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: pre-wrap; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; float: none; display: inline !important; background-color: #f1f0f0;"></span></p>

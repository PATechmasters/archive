<p>Hello, <span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span>!</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>I bet you were all excited about coming back and learning all about how to be a&nbsp;<em>master of technology&nbsp;</em>at the first meeting of the term, where the board finally seems to have their stuff together!</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>You're gonna have to keep waiting. There was a meeting planned for this week, until we had a conversation over board chat and realized that there... really wasn't. Sorry! Take the extra time to learn something cool, like how to underwater
<span><span><span><span><span><span>basketweave</span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;or how to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/programmer-automates-his-job-2015-11">hack the commons coffee machines</a>.</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>There is something useful going on in this email, however - How would Sunday meetings sound for people? We're still working on the specifics (and deciding if we want to be &quot;that club who changed the meeting time six times in the same year&quot;), but there's
 a pretty big chance that we'll finally be able to get back to those computers we took apart for scrap metal last term. We just got permission to use the soldering iron in the
<span><span><span><span>makerspace</span></span></span></span>, so we'd like to move there ASAP.&nbsp;It might not happen this December, but when we come back from break definitely look forward to it! If Sunday in general doesn't work for you but you want to drop
 by, please let us know!</p>

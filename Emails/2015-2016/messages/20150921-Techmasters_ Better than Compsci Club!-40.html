<p>Totally don't have an inferiority complex to CS club. Tooootally not.</p>
<br>
<p>I realize that this is the fourth or fifth email I've sent this week. I apologize, we don't usually spam you this much, I swear. Also, PSA: Not all emails from this club come from me; Karen just happens to be really swamped right now so I'm taking some extra
 turns on the weekly email train. Lucky you guys (if anybody jumps ship to Andover Cole Slaw society, I don't blame you)! So let's waste no time and jump straight to the</p>

<p>COPYPASTED TECHMASTERS MEETING ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>MONDAY 7-8</p>
<br>
<p>FIND OUT WHEN/WHERE THE NEXT MEETING WILL BE</p>
<br>
<p>Tomorrow (or today, depending on whether it takes me longer than 15 minutes to finish this email), we'll be resuming sort of what we were doing last week, which is sort of splitting into advanced/beginner groups and talking more about those things called
 computers. Karen and I <em>did</em> have an actual &quot;lesson&quot; plan scheduled for the next few weeks, but it's been derailed by this thing called &quot;homework&quot;, so we're going to transition a bit into a code workshop instead. Our beginner group will likely be progressing
 a bit more on the first set of Project Euler problems and generally getting more comfortable with using computers to solve problems, and our advanced group can spend some time working on their own projects or helping us with ours. In particular, we're working
 on porting the PAschedules application onto our local server and generally improving our website.Finally, we weren't kidding about learning about the next meeting - this will likely be our last meeting in Gelb 211 (which makes me rather sad, actually, but
 oh well). Where are we meeting next? <em>Who knows?</em> The new room definitely doesn't rhyme with &quot;BAKER'S PLACE&quot;</p>

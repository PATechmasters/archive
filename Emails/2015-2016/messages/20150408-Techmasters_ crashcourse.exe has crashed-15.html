<p>&quot;oh my god it's a techmasters email on wednesday it's been a whole three weeks since that happened&quot;</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>Due to UNFORESEEN COMPLICATIONS with Unity (read: I literally just got it working and it's gonna take me more than two hours to figure out how it ticks), an executive decision has been made to indefinitely postpone the gamedev plan (I can hear the sighs
 of dismay from here; I'm personally super disappointed but such is life). As a backup, we'll instead be covering the basics of functional programming in LISP (that's L-I-S-P, not that thing that maketh you pronounth your wordth like thith) and Haskell.&nbsp;</p>

Hi All!<br>
If you are at all interested, curious, or down right suspicious about gaming and game design, please come by the Nest (in the basement of the OWHL) this Tuesday and Wednesday night at 7pm. &nbsp;We are hosting a gamer theme this week in collaboration with the PA
 Gaming Club. &nbsp;We hope you can make it!<br>
<span>RSVP is here: <span>https</span>://<span>andover</span>.co1.<span>qualtrics</span>.com/SE/?SID=SV_9<span>yOXIjH</span>0<span>qRAr</span>6<span>oR</span></span><br>
<span>Event details are here: &nbsp;<span>http</span>://<span>www</span>.<span>noblenet</span>.<span>org</span>/<span>owhl</span>/nested-presents-gamer-week/</span></p>
<br>
<p><br>
Please join us on Tuesday night<span>&nbsp;at 7 p.m., for a <span>NestED</span> talk by Lisa Stump, software developer and game designer.</span></p>
<br>
<p><br>
<span>Stump works at MIT’s <span>Scheller</span> Teacher Education Program as a software developer heading up the
<span>TaleBlazer</span> team. <span>TaleBlazer</span> is a game platform that allows game designers (including students!) to make and play location-based augmented reality games in their own neighborhoods or at their own locations.In addition to game design,
 Stump runs a programming club using Scratch at her children’s elementary school. She will be discussing her career path as a woman in the tech industry, her experiences working with MIT student coders, and will demo the
<span>TaleBlazer</span> game.</span></p>
<br>

<br>
<p><span><span>Please</span> join us on Wednesday night at 7p.m., for a <span>NestED</span> talk by Dr. Ian Lane Davis, an expert in artificial intelligence and the founder of Mad Doc Software.</span></p>
<br>
<p><br>
<span>In 2008, Mad Doc Software was acquired by <span>Rockstar</span> Games and was
<span>rebranded</span> as <span>Rockstar</span> New England. Davis had his hand in creating games such as: Empire Earth II, Star Trek Armada, Max Payne 3, and Grand Theft Auto V. Davis earned his doctorate in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Carnegie
 Mellon University and has been acknowledged as one of the top Artificial Intelligence experts in the video game industry today.</span></p>

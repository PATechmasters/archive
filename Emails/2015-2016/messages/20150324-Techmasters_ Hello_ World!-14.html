man i really hope this actually works</p>
<br>
<p>UM</p>
<br>
<p>Assuming that you are all actually reading this and I'm not just talking (typing?) at myselfin my bedroom at 3 in the morning (fun fact: though you may be reading this at 2:30 on Tuesday afternoon, this email was written at 3:30 AM this morning, because
 sleeping is hard), I'm just going to say that you all should come to</p>
<br>
<p><br>
TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p>WEDNESDAY AT 1:30</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TERRABYTE OF FUN</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p><br>
&quot;But pres,&quot; you may ask to your computer screen, &quot;what are we doing at this meeting?&quot; For that matter, you may be wondering why this email isn't being sent at strange hours of the night! Luckily, despite the fact that your screen cannot, in fact, respond to
 you (unless you're using Siri and/or S Voice and/or Google Voice and/or Microsoft Sam), you're going to find out right about now! The meeting this week will be nice and meta: &quot;What are we going to dothis term?&quot; (As for the strange hours, we figured it'd be
 a good idea to at least send out the first one at a good time)</p>
<br>
<p><br>
See, shortly before the end of last term, the board sat down together and realized that l̶i̶t̶e̶r̶a̶l̶l̶y̶ ̶n̶o̶n̶e̶ ̶o̶f̶ ̶u̶s̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶q̶u̶a̶l̶i̶f̶i̶e̶d̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶j̶o̶b̶s̶ ̶we can no longer have meetings that consistof four people sitting around
 watching Jake code for a while, as Jake has abdicated his throne! Instead, we had the idea that we could make a game from scratch together or something, but wedecided that we wanted everyone's opinions; maybe some people enjoyed sitting around watching [insert
 co-president here] code!</p>
<br>
<p><br>
SO</p>
<br>
<p><br>
If you have an opinion on what the club should be doing for the rest of the term, or even if you don't</p>
<br>
<p><br>
COME TO</p>
<br>
<p>TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p>WEDNESDAY AT 1:30</p>
<br>
<p>GELB 211</p>
<br>
<p>IT'S A TERRABYTE OF FUN</p>
<br>
<p><br>
One final note, unless things change drastically between the time I'm writing this sentence (4 AM) and the time I send this out (2:15 PM), we're also going to be doing work duty signups tomorrow. BE THERE OR BE STUCK WITH WHATEVER TIMES NOBODY ELSE WANTED</p>

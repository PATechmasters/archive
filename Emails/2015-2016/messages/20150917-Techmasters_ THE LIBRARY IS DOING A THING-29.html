<p>You may or may not have heard of the library's new&nbsp;<em>MAKER SPACE.&nbsp;</em>If you haven't, you should totally go to the basement and check it out - there are laser cutters, sofas, and soon-to-be 3D printers open for general student use. It's also a&nbsp;<em>totally
 sick</em> place to hang out and do homework.</p>
<br>
<p>&quot;Why are you telling us this, Cam?&quot; Well, I'm&nbsp;<em>glad you asked</em>! There are two major things I have to say about this - First, the maker space is actually going to be having its opening party this coming Wednesday (9/23) from 6-8! There's gonna be pizza
 and everything, and it'll be&nbsp;<em>totally sick,&nbsp;</em>and I've been asked to make sure that everyone is invited! Secondly, to you more experienced programmers (or even less experienced people who want to learn), Robotics Club has been trying to get a group of
 coders to help them with their projects, since they have a lot of people who are really good at making the bots but not a lot of people who can deal with the more computerized aspects to potentially make something&nbsp;<em>totally sick</em>. They did specify, though,
 that they'd prefer not to have people who are&nbsp;<em>complete</em> novices, but don't let that discourage you! If you have ideas and want to be paired with someone who does know what they're doing, contact us and we'll try to get groups together to average out
 skill levels as much as we can. Who knows? Even someone with absolutely no knowledge can contribute to making something&nbsp;<em>totally sick</em>.</p>

<p>First things first - there's no meeting this week because of ultimate. GO STUDY SCRUBS because there's nothing else to say in this email.</p>
<br>
<p>Especially not&nbsp;a <b><span style="font-size: large;">GAME&nbsp;NIGHT</span>&nbsp;</b>announcement if you scroll down for a sec...</p>

<br>
<p>Just kidding.</p>
<br>
<p>As we discussed last meeting, this coming Friday (11/13) will be&nbsp;<strong><span><span>Techmasters</span></span> Game Night</strong> - That's pronounced &quot;<span><span>gah</span></span>-<span><span>mey</span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>nee</span></span>-to&quot;, by the
 way. We'll be whipping the PACC into a fury from ~7<span><span>ish</span></span> to 9:30 PM. There will be pizza, soda, candy and all sorts of other assorted goodies. You're welcome to bring whatever system you like -
<span><span>Handheld</span></span>, console, PC (ugh), board games, we'll have all of them! Note that the projector screen (which is what we usually use to play things like
<span><span>wiis</span></span>) will be first-come-first-serve, but otherwise we should have room to accommodate whatever.</p>
<br>
<p><em>But Cam, gaming club does this every Friday!</em></p>
<br>
<p>Shush, you- unlike gaming club, we'll be guaranteed a room this week! Also, we have food. Definitely better, I swear. We're also looking for ideas as to cool things we can do as a group, so if you have something cool you might want to do, let us know or
 bring it in!</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>See you then,</p>
<br>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- The Board</p>

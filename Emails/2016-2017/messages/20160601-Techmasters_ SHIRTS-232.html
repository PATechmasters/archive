<p><span>wow it's been a long time since i've sent one of these and i should probably have sent this with more than two days left</span></p>

<br>
<p>HELLO TECHMASTERS</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>YOU MAY HAVE THOUGHT YOU WERE FREE OF ME</p>
<br>
<p></p>
<br>
<p>YOU WERE WRONG</p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 13px;"></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">You may have seen some people walking around recently with old T</span><span><span>echmaster</span></span><span style="font-size: 13px;">&nbsp;shirts, such as the black-and-green OIT shirts
 from last year. Well,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">for just $4.99</span> you, too, can be rocking like a historical
<span><span>mechtaster</span></span>! If you want a free shirt, please let me know and I'll find a way to get one to you in the next two days (don't worry, you'll get your choice of your favorite). For what it's worth, if I can't give these all away I'm probably
 going to either dump them on next year's board or (more likely) just throw them away, so take them while they're hot!</span></p>

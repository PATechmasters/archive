<p>Hi Techmasters,</p>
<p>Some follow up from today’s meeting:<br>
<br>
<strong>In real CTF contests, you <em>can</em> and <em>often have to</em> use the internet.</strong> Even if you’ve been doing this for years. The point is agility, not memorization. Use any tools and resources you want; the only thing you’re not supposed to
 do is ask a human for help. <br>
<br>
<strong><a href="https://ctf.techmasters.io" target="_blank">TMCTF</a> is just for practice.</strong> This means scores don’t matter. More importantly, it means you
<em>can</em> and <em>should</em> ask humans for help. Ask your peers, ask us, <a href="mailto:techmasters@andover.edu" target="_blank">
email us</a>, whatever.<br>
<br>
<strong>Don’t give up; look up solutions for TMCTF problems.</strong> All of them are real problems from past CTFs, so if you search for the problem name and CTF name (in parenthesis at the end of each problem), you’ll find that people have posted solutions.<br>
<br>
<strong>This isn’t cheating; it’s learning.</strong> I couldn’t have done these problems when I was starting out. You need a base, and looking up solutions and
<em>solving the problems by yourself afterward</em>&nbsp;is an awesome way to build it.<br>
<br>
<strong>The server problems from meeting one are still up and running!</strong> Let us know if you’re facing issues or just don’t know where to start on a particular level.<br>
<br>
<strong>Most of all, remember this:</strong> We don’t care whether you got it right the first time. We care whether you get it now, and all of us here are here to make that happen.</p>
<p>Happy hacking,<br>
The Board</p>

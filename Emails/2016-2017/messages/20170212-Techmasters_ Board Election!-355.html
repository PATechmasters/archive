<p>Hello Techmasters,</p>
<p>As announced during the meeting today, the Techmasters Board Election will be held on Sunday, February 19, 2017 during our meeting at 2 PM in the Makerspace. Here is how the process will work:
<br>
<br>
1) All candidates must complete a board application. If you would like to be a candidate, please fill out the online form by 6pm on Friday, February 17, 2017. The form is available at
<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/PXzuLXxfZELSfqxl2" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/forms/PXzuLXxfZELSfqxl2</a>.
<br>
2) The completed board application of each candidate will be distributed among members of the club to better inform the electorate.
<br>
3) Candidates who have completed the form will give a brief 2-minute speech during our meeting on Sunday, February 19, 2017,* telling us why they should be on the board of Techmasters.<br>
4) In that same meeting, we will hold the election. Club members who are physically present and have attended at least four meetings in the 2016-2017 school year prior to February 20, 2017 will be eligible to vote.
<br>
5) The new board will be announced on or before Friday, February 24, 2017. The new board will take office on Sunday, February 26, 2017 at 2:30 pm.
<br>
<br>
Available positions are: <br>
<br>
President (or 2 Co-Presidents) <br>
Assistant President <br>
Webmaster <br>
Server Administrator <br>
<br>
Although each position has its own set of responsibilities, all board members are expected to run meetings.
<br>
<br>
We welcome all interested members of the club to fill out the form and run in this election! This is a great opportunity for you to become more involved and share your knowledge with other people.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the elections!<br>
— The Board</p>
<p>*If you absolutely cannot make it to the meeting on February 19 but would still like to run, please let us know by February 18 and explain your circumstances. You can still run.</p>

<p>Hello Techmasters, <br>
<br>
Hope you are enjoying summer! In case you missed it: <br>
<br>
Want to get back to campus early, ‘blitzing’ dorms, solving tech issues, and disillusioning freshmen of any notion that their wireless printer will ever work? Reply ASAP if you did not already receive an email confirmation.
<br>
<br>
This is a great opportunity to help out new students with anything technology-related, using your experience as a Techmaster / returning student. Once approved, you can plan to return on Monday, September 5th. Here's the full schedule:
<br>
<br>
Sep 5: 1pm - 2pm - registration <br>
Sep 5: 3pm - 3:30 pm - orientation meeting @ PACC <br>
Sep 6: evening - dorm blitz (to be assigned) <br>
Sep 7: 1pm - 3pm - tech help in OWHL (tba) <br>
Sep 7: 8:30pm - 10:30pm - dorm blitz (tba) <br>
Sep 8: 10:30am - 4:30pm - tech help in OWHL (tba) <br>
Sep 10: 9pm-11pm - dorm blitz (tba) <br>
<br>
As dorm blitz and OWHL help sessions are to be assigned, you do not have to commit to all of the time slots above.
<br>
<br>
Please let us know ASAP if you are interested but have not already registered. In any case, we look forward to seeing you in September!
<br>
<br>
Love, <br>
The Board</p>

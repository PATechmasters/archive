<p>It's that time of term again! Somehow or another we've wound our way down to the end of the term, and we're going to be celebrating that fact with
<span><span>Techmasters</span></span>&nbsp;Game Night tomorrow. We're not going to have a repeat of last term where somehow the end of term arrived before Game Night did. Not sure what kind of scrubs could've let that happen. Since we're so much better organized
 this term, we have successfully put together a Game Night for you all!</p>
<br>
<p>There will be video games, there will be board games, and of course there will be food during<span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong><span><span>Techmasters</span></span>&nbsp;Game Night tomorrow evening from 7:00 to 9:30 in the PACC</strong></span></p>
<br>
<p>It'll be a <span><span>terrabyte</span></span> of fun<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark_symbol" title="Trademark symbol" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0b0080; background: none;">™</a>, so be sure to bring all your friends! Hope to see
 you all tomorrow!</p>

<p>Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span> has been in existence since
<a href="http://pdf.phillipian.net/1996/09201996.pdf" target="_blank">at least 1996</a>, and the current
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span> Constitution was passed on March 4, 2008. Since then, this Constitution has governed the proper functioning of the organization.<br>
<br>
The 2008 <span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span> Constitution provides for an amendment process. With the unanimous consent of the board, we would like to formally propose an amendment to the Constitution, to
 provide updates, as well as more explicit definitions and clarifications, to ensure that
<span><span><span><span><span><span>Techmasters</span></span></span></span></span></span> continues to run smoothly in the future.<br>
<br>
We will be holding a formal, club-wide vote on this amendment at the end of our meeting this Sunday, February 12, 2017, at 2 pm. As defined by our current Constitution, you are eligible to vote if you have attended “at least four of the past six scheduled meetings.”
 This includes this weekend's meeting. We do have records, so if you are unsure, we will let you know on Sunday.<br>
<br>

the current Constitution</a>, <a href="https://static.techmasters.io/constitution-2017-proposed-signed.pdf" target="_blank">
the proposed amended version</a>, as well as a <a href="https://static.techmasters.io/constitution-diff.pdf" target="_blank">
<span><span><span><span><span><span>diff</span></span></span></span></span></span> file</a> that illustrates the proposed changes. The
<span><span><span><span><span><span>diff</span></span></span></span></span></span> file is for illustrative purposes only. The amendment would pass if 2/3 of the eligible club membership vote in favor.<br>
<br>
In any case, Miles has prepared a great meeting about <span><span><span><span><span><span>VPNs</span></span></span></span></span></span> and the Tor network for this Sunday. As always, snacks will be provided. We look forward to seeing you in the
<span><span><span><span>Makerspace</span></span></span></span>!<br>
